                <h2>ABOUT</h2>
                <p>This website is dedicate to the aliens of the Sims 2 DS and GBA, two console spin-offs to EA's game, the Sims 2. Despite what their names would lead you to think, these are not just ports of the Sims 2 but rather whole new games with their own unique mechanics. One example of this would be in the Sims 2 DS, where all your regular need meters are replaced with a single "Sanity" meter. The Sims 2 GBA is less of a simulator and more of a story game that follows an episodic structure and has a finale, unlike most Sims games.<br><br>The reason why the founders of this site specifically lock onto these games is that after their creation, the aliens took on a humanoid form (very unnappleaing). These games also introduced us to the characters of Emperor Xizzle and Burple, who we really like. There is also Agent Keeble but no one really likes him. This is because he only has like 1 line in the Sims 2 GBA and then never talks again. Meanwhile, both Emperor Xizzle and Burple can be interacted with in the Sims 2 GBA. In the Sims 2 DS, Emperor Xizzle is one of the main antagonists that follows you through the game, commanding an army of aliens that attack StrangeTown every so often (notably when you time travel). Dataminers have also discovered that Burple was intended to be a character you can interact with, like Emperor Xizzle, but was seemingly cut.<br><br>This website was founded thanks to extreme brainrot from a select few.</p>
